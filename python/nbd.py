    not request block sizes, the server may reject the

        Disable TLS. (The default setting, unless using

        This setting is also necessary if you use

        with a server that implements the NBD protocol's
        "SELECTIVETLS" mode, prior to enabling TLS with

        support prefer the NBD protocol's "FORCEDTLS" mode,
        so this sort of manual interaction tends to be
        useful mainly during integration testing.

    "TLS_ALLOW"
        Enable TLS if possible.

        This option is insecure (or best effort) in that in
        some cases it will fall back to an unencrypted
        and/or unauthenticated connection if TLS could not
        be established. Use "TLS_REQUIRE" below if the
        connection must be encrypted.

        Some servers will drop the connection if TLS fails
        so fallback may not be possible.

    "TLS_REQUIRE"
        Require an encrypted and authenticated TLS
        connection. Always fail to connect if the connection
        is not encrypted and authenticated.

    As well as calling this you may also need to supply the

    ("nbd.set_tls_certificates"), the username
    ("nbd.set_tls_username") and/or the Pre-Shared Keys
    (PSK) file ("nbd.set_tls_psk_file"). For now, when using
    "nbd.connect_uri", any URI query parameters related to

    since omitting a handshake flag can prevent the use of
    other functionality such as TLS encryption or structured
    replies. However, for integration testing, it can be
    useful to reduce the set of flags supported by the
    client to test that a particular server can handle
    various clients that were compliant to older versions of
    the NBD specification.

    The "flags" argument is a bitmask, including zero or
    more of the following handshake flags:

    "HANDSHAKE_FLAG_FIXED_NEWSTYLE" = 1
        The server gracefully handles unknown option
        requests from the client, rather than disconnecting.
        Without this flag, a client cannot safely request to
        use extensions such as TLS encryption or structured
        replies, as the request may cause an older server to
        drop the connection.

    "HANDSHAKE_FLAG_NO_ZEROES" = 2
        If the client is forced to use "NBD_OPT_EXPORT_NAME"
        instead of the preferred "NBD_OPT_GO", this flag
        allows the server to send fewer all-zero padding
        bytes over the connection.

    For convenience, the constant "HANDSHAKE_FLAG_MASK" is
    available to describe all flags supported by this build
    of libnbd. Future NBD extensions may add further flags,
    which in turn may be enabled by default in newer libnbd.
    As such, when attempting to disable only one specific
    bit, it is wiser to first call "nbd.get_handshake_flags"

    a client application passed in an uninitialized buffer

    However, for a client application that has audited that

    (although the time spent in pre-initialization may pale

    def set_strict_mode(self, flags):

    By default, libnbd tries to detect requests that would
    trigger undefined behavior in the NBD protocol, and
    rejects them client side without causing any network
    traffic, rather than risking undefined server behavior.
    However, for integration testing, it can be handy to
    relax the strictness of libnbd, to coerce it into
    sending such requests over the network for testing the
    robustness of the server in dealing with such traffic.

    The "flags" argument is a bitmask, including zero or
    more of the following strictness flags:

    "STRICT_COMMANDS" = 0x1
        If set, this flag rejects client requests that do
        not comply with the set of advertised server flags
        (for example, attempting a write on a read-only
        server, or attempting to use "CMD_FLAG_FUA" when
        "nbd.can_fua" returned false). If clear, this flag
        relies on the server to reject unexpected commands.

    "STRICT_FLAGS" = 0x2
        If set, this flag rejects client requests that
        attempt to set a command flag not recognized by
        libnbd (those outside of "CMD_FLAG_MASK"), or a flag
        not normally associated with a command (such as
        using "CMD_FLAG_FUA" on a read command). If clear,
        all flags are sent on to the server, even if sending
        such a flag may cause the server to change its reply
        in a manner that confuses libnbd, perhaps causing
        deadlock or ending the connection.

        Flags that are known by libnbd as associated with a
        given command (such as "CMD_FLAG_DF" for
        "nbd.pread_structured" gated by "nbd.can_df") are
        controlled by "STRICT_COMMANDS" instead; and
        "CMD_FLAG_PAYLOAD_LEN" is managed automatically by
        libnbd unless "STRICT_AUTO_FLAG" is disabled.

        Note that the NBD protocol only supports 16 bits of
        command flags, even though the libnbd API uses
        "uint32_t"; bits outside of the range permitted by
        the protocol are always a client-side error.

    "STRICT_BOUNDS" = 0x4
        If set, this flag rejects client requests that would
        exceed the export bounds without sending any traffic
        to the server. If clear, this flag relies on the
        server to detect out-of-bounds requests.

    "STRICT_ZERO_SIZE" = 0x8
        If set, this flag rejects client requests with
        length 0. If clear, this permits zero-length
        requests to the server, which may produce undefined
        results.

    "STRICT_ALIGN" = 0x10
        If set, and the server provided minimum block sizes
        (see "SIZE_MINIMUM" for "nbd.get_block_size"), this
        flag rejects client requests that do not have length
        and offset aligned to the server's minimum
        requirements. If clear, unaligned requests are sent
        to the server, where it is up to the server whether
        to honor or reject the request.

    "STRICT_PAYLOAD" = 0x20
        If set, the client refuses to send a command to the
        server with more than libnbd's outgoing payload
        maximum (see "SIZE_PAYLOAD" for
        "nbd.get_block_size"), whether or not the server
        advertised a block size maximum. If clear, oversize
        requests up to 64MiB may be attempted, although
        requests larger than 32MiB are liable to cause some
        servers to disconnect.

    "STRICT_AUTO_FLAG" = 0x40
        If set, commands that accept the
        "CMD_FLAG_PAYLOAD_LEN" flag (such as "nbd.pwrite"
        and nbd_block_status_filter(3)) ignore the presence
        or absence of that flag from the caller, instead
        sending the value over the wire that matches the
        server's expectations based on whether extended
        headers were negotiated when the connection was
        made. If clear, the caller takes on the
        responsibility for whether the payload length flag
        is set or clear during the affected command, which
        can be useful during integration testing but is more
        likely to lead to undefined behavior.

    For convenience, the constant "STRICT_MASK" is available
    to describe all strictness flags supported by this build
    of libnbd. Future versions of libnbd may add further
    flags, which are likely to be enabled by default for
    additional client-side filtering. As such, when
    attempting to relax only one specific bit while keeping
    remaining checks at the client side, it is wiser to
    first call "nbd.get_strict_mode" and modify that value,
    rather than blindly setting a constant value.

    to the ready state, when communicating with a newstyle
    server. This setting has no effect when connecting to an

    When option mode is enabled, you have fine-grained
    control over which options are negotiated, compared to
    the default of the server negotiating everything on your
    behalf using settings made before starting the
    connection. To leave the mode and proceed on to the

    used if "nbd.set_opt_mode" enabled option mode;
    furthermore, libnbd defaults to automatically requesting
    this unless you use "nbd.set_request_structured_replies"
    prior to connecting. This function is mainly useful for
    integration testing of corner cases in server handling.

    This function returns true if the server replies with
    success, false if the server replies with an error, and
    fails only if the server does not reply (such as for a
    loss of connection). Note that some servers fail a
    second request as redundant; libnbd assumes that once
    one request has succeeded, then structured replies are
    supported (as visible by
    "nbd.get_structured_replies_negotiated") regardless if
    later calls to this function return false. Similarly, a
    server may fail this request if extended headers are
    already negotiated, since extended headers take
    priority.

    Request that the server list all exports that it

    enabled option mode.

    The "list" function is called once per advertised
    export, with any "user_data" passed to this function,
    and with "name" and "description" supplied by the
    server. Many servers omit descriptions, in which case
    "description" will be an empty string. Remember that it

    the context of the callback function; rather, your code
    must copy any "name" needed for later use after this
    function completes. At present, the return value of the
    callback is ignored, although a return of -1 should be
    avoided.

    For convenience, when this function succeeds, it returns
    the number of exports that were advertised by the
    server.

    Not all servers understand this request, and even when
    it is understood, the server might intentionally send an
    empty list to avoid being an information leak, may
    encounter a failure after delivering partial results, or
    may refuse to answer more than one query per connection
    in the interest of avoiding negotiation that does not
    resolve. Thus, this function may succeed even when no
    exports are reported, or may fail but have a non-empty
    list. Likewise, the NBD protocol does not specify an
    upper bound for the number of exports that might be
    advertised, so client code should be aware that a server
    may send a lengthy list.

    For nbd-server(1) you will need to allow clients to make
    list requests by adding "allowlist=true" to the
    "[generic]" section of /etc/nbd-server/config. For
    qemu-nbd(8), a description is set with *-D*.

  Example URIs supported
    "nbd://example.com"
        Connect over TCP, unencrypted, to "example.com" port
        10809.

    "nbds://example.com"
        Connect over TCP with TLS, to "example.com" port
        10809. If the server does not support TLS then this
        will fail.

    "nbd+unix:///foo?socket=/tmp/nbd.sock"
        Connect over the Unix domain socket /tmp/nbd.sock to
        an NBD server running locally. The export name is
        set to "foo" (note without any leading "/"
        character).

    "nbds+unix://alice@/?socket=/tmp/nbd.sock&tls-certificat
    es=certs"
        Connect over a Unix domain socket, enabling TLS and
        setting the path to a directory containing
        certificates and keys.

    "nbd+vsock:///"
        In this scenario libnbd is running in a virtual
        machine. Connect over "AF_VSOCK" to an NBD server
        running on the hypervisor.

  Supported URI formats
    The following schemes are supported in the current
    version of libnbd:

    "nbd:"
        Connect over TCP without using TLS.

    "nbds:"
        Connect over TCP. TLS is required and the connection
        will fail if the server does not support TLS.

    "nbd+unix:"
    "nbds+unix:"
        Connect over a Unix domain socket, without or with
        TLS respectively. The "socket" parameter is
        required.

    "nbd+vsock:"
    "nbds+vsock:"
        Connect over the "AF_VSOCK" transport, without or
        with TLS respectively. You can use
        "nbd.supports_vsock" to see if this build of libnbd
        supports "AF_VSOCK".

    The authority part of the URI
    ("[username@][servername][:port]") is parsed depending
    on the transport. For TCP it specifies the server to
    connect to and optional port number. For "+unix" it
    should not be present. For "+vsock" the server name is
    the numeric CID (eg. 2 to connect to the host), and the
    optional port number may be present. If the "username"
    is present it is used for TLS authentication.

    For all transports, an export name may be present,
    parsed in accordance with the NBD URI specification.

    Finally the query part of the URI can contain:

    socket=SOCKET
        Specifies the Unix domain socket to connect on. Must
        be present for the "+unix" transport and must not be
        present for the other transports.

    tls-certificates=DIR
        Set the certificates directory. See
        "nbd.set_tls_certificates". Note this is not allowed
        by default - see next section.

    tls-psk-file=PSKFILE
        Set the PSK file. See "nbd.set_tls_psk_file". Note
        this is not allowed by default - see next section.

  Disable URI features
    For security reasons you might want to disable certain
    URI features. Pre-filtering URIs is error-prone and
    should not be attempted. Instead use the libnbd APIs
    below to control what can appear in URIs. Note you must
    call these functions on the same handle before calling
    "nbd.connect_uri" or "nbd.aio_connect_uri".

    TCP, Unix domain socket or "AF_VSOCK" transports
        Default: all allowed

        To select which transports are allowed call

    TLS Default: both non-TLS and TLS connections allowed

        To force TLS off or on in URIs call
        "nbd.set_uri_allow_tls".

    Connect to Unix domain socket in the local filesystem
        Default: allowed

        To prevent this you must disable the "+unix"
        transport using "nbd.set_uri_allow_transports".

    Read from local files
        Default: denied

        To allow URIs to contain references to local files
        (eg. for parameters like "tls-psk-file") call
        "nbd.set_uri_allow_local_file".

  Overriding the export name
    It is possible to override the export name portion of a
    URI by using "nbd.set_opt_mode" to enable option mode,
    then using "nbd.set_export_name" and "nbd.opt_go" as
    part of subsequent negotiation.

  Optional features
    This call will fail if libnbd was not compiled with
    libxml2; you can test whether this is the case with
    "nbd.supports_uri".

    Support for URIs that require TLS will fail if libnbd
    was not compiled with gnutls; you can test whether this
    is the case with "nbd.supports_tls".

    Returns a specific size constraint advertised by the

    not advertise a constraint. "size_type" must be one of
    the following constraints:

    "SIZE_MINIMUM" = 0
        If non-zero, this will be a power of 2 between 1 and
        64k; any client request that is not aligned in
        length or offset to this size is likely to fail with
        "EINVAL". The image size will generally also be a
        multiple of this value (if not, the final few bytes
        are inaccessible while obeying alignment
        constraints). If zero, it is safest to assume a
        minimum block size of 512, although many servers
        support a minimum block size of 1. If the server
        provides a constraint, then libnbd defaults to
        honoring that constraint client-side unless
        "STRICT_ALIGN" is cleared in nbd_set_strict_mode(3).

    "SIZE_PREFERRED" = 1
        If non-zero, this is a power of 2 representing the
        preferred size for efficient I/O. Smaller requests
        may incur overhead such as read-modify-write cycles
        that will not be present when using I/O that is a
        multiple of this value. This value may be larger
        than the size of the export. If zero, using 4k as a
        preferred block size tends to give decent
        performance.

    "SIZE_MAXIMUM" = 2
        If non-zero, this represents the maximum length that
        the server is willing to handle during "nbd.pread"
        or "nbd.pwrite". Other functions like "nbd.zero" may
        still be able to use larger sizes. Note that this
        function returns what the server advertised, but
        libnbd itself imposes a maximum of 64M. If zero,
        some NBD servers will abruptly disconnect if a
        transaction involves more than 32M.

    "SIZE_PAYLOAD" = 3
        This value is not advertised by the server, but
        rather represents the maximum outgoing payload size
        for a given connection that libnbd will enforce
        unless "STRICT_PAYLOAD" is cleared in
        nbd_set_strict_mode(3). It is always non-zero: never
        smaller than 1M, never larger than 64M, and matches
        "SIZE_MAXIMUM" when possible.

    Future NBD extensions may result in additional
    "size_type" values. Note that by default, libnbd
    requests all available block sizes, but that a server
    may differ in what sizes it chooses to report if
    "nbd.set_request_block_size" alters whether the client
    requests sizes.

    "nbd.pread_structured", if finer visibility is required
    into the server's replies, or if you want to use
    "CMD_FLAG_DF".

    Note that libnbd currently enforces a maximum read
    buffer of 64MiB, even if the server would permit a
    larger buffer in a single transaction; attempts to
    exceed this will result in an "ERANGE" error. The server
    may enforce a smaller limit, which can be learned with
    "nbd.get_block_size".

    The "flags" parameter must be 0 for now (it exists for

    results from the server. If "nbd.get_pread_initialize"

    the contents are undefined on failure.

    By default, libnbd will reject attempts to use this
    function with parameters that are likely to result in

    which may arrive out of order before reassembly into the
    original buffer; the "chunk" callback is used for
    notification after each chunk arrives, and may perform
    additional sanity checking on the server's reply. The
    callback cannot call "nbd_*" APIs on the same handle
    since it holds the handle lock and will cause a
    deadlock. If the callback returns -1, and no earlier
    error has been detected, then the overall read command
    will fail with any non-zero value stored into the
    callback's "error" parameter (with a default of
    "EPROTO"); but any further chunks will still invoke the
    callback.

    The "chunk" function is called once per chunk of data
    received, with the "user_data" passed to this function.
    The "subbuf" and "count" parameters represent the subset
    of the original buffer which has just been populated by
    results from the server (in C, "subbuf" always points
    within the original "buf"; but this guarantee may not
    extend to other language bindings). The "offset"
    parameter represents the absolute offset at which
    "subbuf" begins within the image (note that this is not
    the relative offset of "subbuf" within the original
    buffer "buf"). Changes to "error" on output are ignored
    unless the callback fails. The input meaning of the
    "error" parameter is controlled by the "status"
    parameter, which is one of

    "READ_DATA" = 1
        "subbuf" was populated with "count" bytes of data.
        On input, "error" contains the errno value of any
        earlier detected error, or zero.

    "READ_HOLE" = 2
        "subbuf" represents a hole, and contains "count" NUL
        bytes. On input, "error" contains the errno value of
        any earlier detected error, or zero.

    "READ_ERROR" = 3
        "count" is 0, so "subbuf" is unusable. On input,
        "error" contains the errno value reported by the
        server as occurring while reading that "offset",
        regardless if any earlier error has been detected.

    Future NBD extensions may permit other values for
    "status", but those will not be returned to a client
    that has not opted in to requesting such extensions. If
    the server is non-compliant, it is possible for the
    "chunk" function to be called more times than you expect
    or with "count" 0 for "READ_DATA" or "READ_HOLE". It is
    also possible that the "chunk" function is not called at
    all (in particular, "READ_ERROR" is used only when an
    error is associated with a particular offset, and not
    when the server reports a generic error), but you are
    guaranteed that the callback was called at least once if
    the overall read succeeds. Libnbd does not validate that
    the server obeyed the requirement that a read call must
    not have overlapping chunks and must not succeed without
    enough chunks to cover the entire request.

    Note that libnbd currently enforces a maximum read
    buffer of 64MiB, even if the server would permit a
    larger buffer in a single transaction; attempts to
    exceed this will result in an "ERANGE" error. The server
    may enforce a smaller limit, which can be learned with
    "nbd.get_block_size".

    The "flags" parameter may be 0 for no flags, or may
    contain "CMD_FLAG_DF" meaning that the server should not
    reply with more than one fragment (if that is supported
    - some servers cannot do this, see "nbd.can_df"). Libnbd
    does not validate that the server actually obeys the
    flag.

    Note that if this command fails, and
    "nbd.get_pread_initialize" returns true, then libnbd
    sanitized "buf", but it is unspecified whether the
    contents of "buf" will read as zero or as partial
    results from the server. If "nbd.get_pread_initialize"
    returns false, then libnbd did not sanitize "buf", and
    the contents are undefined on failure.

    By default, libnbd will reject attempts to use this
    function with parameters that are likely to result in
    server failure, such as requesting an unknown command
    flag. The "nbd.set_strict_mode" function can be used to
    alter which scenarios should await a server reply rather
    than failing fast.

    the server may choose to return less status, or the
    final block may extend beyond the requested range. If
    multiple contexts are supported, the number of blocks
    and cumulative length of those blocks need not be
    identical between contexts.

    Note that not all servers can support a "count" of 4GiB

    inherently limited to 32-bit values. If the server
    replies with a larger extent, the length of that extent
    will be truncated to just below 32 bits and any further
    extents from the server will be ignored. If the server
    replies with a status value larger than 32 bits (only
    possible when extended headers are in use), the callback
    function will be passed an "EOVERFLOW" error. To get the
    full extent information from a server that supports
    64-bit extents, you must use "nbd.block_status_64".

    Depending on which metadata contexts were enabled before
    connecting (see "nbd.add_meta_context") and which are
    supported by the server (see "nbd.can_meta_context")
    this call returns information about extents by calling
    back to the "extent" function. The callback cannot call
    "nbd_*" APIs on the same handle since it holds the
    handle lock and will cause a deadlock. If the callback
    returns -1, and no earlier error has been detected, then
    the overall block status command will fail with any
    non-zero value stored into the callback's "error"
    parameter (with a default of "EPROTO"); but any further
    contexts will still invoke the callback.

    The "extent" function is called once per type of
    metadata available, with the "user_data" passed to this
    function. The "metacontext" parameter is a string such
    as "base:allocation". The "entries" array is an array of
    pairs of integers with the first entry in each pair
    being the length (in bytes) of the block and the second
    entry being a status/flags field which is specific to
    the metadata context. The number of pairs passed to the
    function is "nr_entries/2". The NBD protocol document in
    the section about "NBD_REPLY_TYPE_BLOCK_STATUS"
    describes the meaning of this array; for contexts known
    to libnbd, <libnbd.h> contains constants beginning with
    "STATE_" that may help decipher the values. On entry to
    the callback, the "error" parameter contains the errno
    value of any previously detected error, but even if an
    earlier error was detected, the current "metacontext"
    and "entries" are valid.

    It is possible for the extent function to be called more
    times than you expect (if the server is buggy), so
    always check the "metacontext" field to ensure you are
    receiving the data you expect. It is also possible that
    the extent function is not called at all, even for
    metadata contexts that you requested. This indicates
    either that the server doesn't support the context or
    for some other reason cannot return the data.

    The "flags" parameter may be 0 for no flags, or may
    contain "CMD_FLAG_REQ_ONE" meaning that the server

    returns

    0   We are not expected to interact with the server file
        descriptor from the current state. It is not worth
        attempting to use poll(2); if the connection is not
        dead, then state machine progress must instead come
        from some other means such as "nbd.aio_connect".

    "AIO_DIRECTION_READ" = 1
        We are expected next to read from the server. If
        using poll(2) you would set "events = POLLIN". If
        "revents" returns "POLLIN" or "POLLHUP" you would
        then call "nbd.aio_notify_read".

        Note that once libnbd reaches "nbd.aio_is_ready",
        this direction is returned even when there are no
        commands in flight (see "nbd.aio_in_flight"). In a
        single-threaded use of libnbd, it is not worth
        polling until after issuing a command, as otherwise
        the server will never wake up the poll. In a
        multi-threaded scenario, you can have one thread
        begin a polling loop prior to any commands, but any
        other thread that issues a command will need a way
        to kick the polling thread out of poll in case
        issuing the command changes the needed polling
        direction. Possible ways to do this include polling
        for activity on a pipe-to-self, or using
        pthread_kill(3) to send a signal that is masked
        except during ppoll(2).

    "AIO_DIRECTION_WRITE" = 2
        We are expected next to write to the server. If
        using poll(2) you would set "events = POLLOUT". If
        "revents" returns "POLLOUT" you would then call
        "nbd.aio_notify_write".

    "AIO_DIRECTION_BOTH" = 3
        We are expected next to either read or write to the
        server. If using poll(2) you would set "events =
        POLLIN|POLLOUT". If only one of "POLLIN" or
        "POLLOUT" is returned, then see above. However, if
        both are returned, it is better to call only
        "nbd.aio_notify_read", as processing the server's
        reply may change the state of the connection and
        invalidate the need to write more commands.
