directory

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 #include <libnbd.h>

 int nbd_set_tls_certificates (
       struct nbd_handle *h, const char *dir
     );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Set the path to the TLS certificates directory.  If not
set and TLS is used then a compiled in default is used.
For root this is C</etc/pki/libnbd/>.  For non-root this is
C<$HOME/.pki/libnbd> and C<$HOME/.config/pki/libnbd>.  If
none of these directories can be found then the system
trusted CAs are used.

This function may be called regardless of whether TLS is
supported, but will have no effect unless L<nbd_set_tls(3)>
is also used to request or require TLS.

=head1 HANDLE STATE

newly created,
otherwise this call will return an error.
