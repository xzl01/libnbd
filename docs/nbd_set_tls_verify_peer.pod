Set this flag to control whether libnbd will verify the identity
of the server from the server's certificate and the certificate
authority.  This defaults to true when connecting to TCP servers
using TLS certificate authentication, and false otherwise.

This function may be called regardless of whether TLS is
supported, but will have no effect unless L<nbd_set_tls(3)>
is also used to request or require TLS.

Refer to L<libnbd(3)/ERROR HANDLING>

=head1 HANDLE STATE

The handle must be
newly created,
otherwise this call will return an error.

=head1 VERSION

This function first appeared in libnbd 1.0.

If you need to test if this function is available at compile time
check if the following macro is defined:

 #define LIBNBD_HAVE_NBD_SET_TLS_VERIFY_PEER 1
