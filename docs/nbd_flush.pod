=head1 NAME

nbd_flush - send flush command to the NBD server

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 #include <libnbd.h>

 int nbd_flush (
       struct nbd_handle *h, uint32_t flags
     );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Issue the flush command to the NBD server.  The function should
return when all write commands which have completed have been
committed to permanent storage on the server.  Note this will
generally return an error if L<nbd_can_flush(3)> is false.

The C<flags> parameter must be C<0> for now (it exists for future NBD
protocol extensions).

By default, libnbd will reject attempts to use this function with
parameters that are likely to result in server failure, such as
requesting an unknown command flag.  The L<nbd_set_strict_mode(3)>
function can be used to alter which scenarios should await a server
reply rather than failing fast.

=head1 RETURN VALUE

If the call is successful the function returns C<0>.

=head1 ERRORS

On error C<-1> is returned.

Refer to L<libnbd(3)/ERROR HANDLING>
for how to get further details of the error.

The following parameters must not be NULL: C<h>.
For more information see L<libnbd(3)/Non-NULL parameters>.

=head1 HANDLE STATE

The handle must be
connected with the server,
otherwise this call will return an error.

=head1 VERSION

This function first appeared in libnbd 1.0.

If you need to test if this function is available at compile time
check if the following macro is defined:

 #define LIBNBD_HAVE_NBD_FLUSH 1
