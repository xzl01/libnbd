=head1 NAME

nbd_set_request_structured_replies - control use of structured replies

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 #include <libnbd.h>

 int nbd_set_request_structured_replies (
       struct nbd_handle *h, bool request
     );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

By default, libnbd tries to negotiate structured replies with the
server, as this protocol extension must be in use before
L<nbd_can_meta_context(3)> or L<nbd_can_df(3)> can return true.  However,
for integration testing, it can be useful to clear this flag
rather than find a way to alter the server to fail the negotiation
request.  It is also useful to set this to false prior to using
L<nbd_set_opt_mode(3)> if it is desired to control when to send
L<nbd_opt_structured_reply(3)> during negotiation.

Note that setting this knob to false also disables any automatic
request for extended headers.

=head1 HANDLE STATE

newly created,
otherwise this call will return an error.
