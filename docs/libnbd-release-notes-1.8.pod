libnbd-release-notes-1.8 - release notes for libnbd 1.8

=head1 DESCRIPTION

These are the release notes for libnbd stable release 1.8.
This describes the major changes since 1.6.

libnbd 1.8.0 was released on B<7 June 2021>.

libnbd is now hosted on gitlab:
L<https://listman.redhat.com/archives/libguestfs/2021-February/msg00021.html>

=head2 Security

If you find a security issue, please read F<SECURITY> in the source
(online here:
L<https://gitlab.com/nbdkit/libnbd/blob/master/SECURITY>).  To
find out about previous security issues in libnbd, see
L<libnbd-security(3)>.

There was one security bug found in libnbd during this
release cycle.

=head3 CVE-2021-20286
denial of service when using L<nbd_set_opt_mode(3)>

See the full announcement here:
L<https://listman.redhat.com/archives/libguestfs/2021-March/msg00092.html>
(Found and fixed by Eric Blake).

=head2 New APIs

=over 4

=item L<nbd_get_private_data(3)>

=item L<nbd_set_private_data(3)>

These calls allow you to store either an unsigned integer or a pointer
in the handle for the application to use for its own purposes.

=item L<nbd_get_uri(3)>

This call constructs an NBD URI which can be used to connect back to
the same server (using L<nbd_connect_uri(3)> or from other tools that
support the NBD URI standard).

=back

=head2 Enhancements to existing APIs

Numeric IPv6 URIs (like C<nbd://[::1]/>) are now supported.

libnbd gives a better error message if the server backlog overflows
(thanks Xin Long, Lukas Doktor, Eric Blake, Martin Kletzander).

=head2 New features

Continuous integration (CI) tests now run on every commit and merge
request to the upstream repository (Martin Kletzander).

=head2 Tools

A great deal of work has been done to improve the performance of
L<nbdcopy(1)> (Nir Soffer, Eric Blake).

On Linux, nbdcopy now uses readahead when reading from files, and
takes steps to preserve the host page cache.

nbdcopy new I<--request-size> option to allow controlling the size of
requests made to NBD servers.  Adjusting this can affect performance
(Nir Soffer).

nbdcopy now supports C<null:> pseudo-target, where it discards the
output.  This is useful for benchmarking.

nbdcopy new I<-v> flag to enable libnbd and other debugging.

L<nbdinfo(1)> I<--list> (which lists all exports of a server) no
longer exits early if one of the exports is inaccessible or there is a
recoverable error (Eric Blake).

nbdinfo now prints the URI of each export in the output making it
easier to connect back to each export.

L<nbdfuse(1)> is now multithreaded and supports issuing parallel NBD
commands on a single connection as well as multi-conn, and other
enhancements have been made.  This resulted in around 50% performance
improvement when tested with fio.

nbdfuse now supports nbdcopy-style C<[ CMD ]>, eg:
 nbdfuse dir/ramdisk [ nbdkit memory 1G ]

nbdfuse now supports trimming.  Also it supports fast zeroing, but
this requires a forthcoming kernel patch before it will work.

nbdfuse sets the virtual file permissions appropriately if the NBD
export is read-only.

nbdfuse new I<-v> flag to enable libnbd and other debugging.

=head2 Tests

Added a test of interoperability with L<qemu-storage-daemon(1)>.  Note
that qemu-storage-daemon was broken in qemu 6.0.0 so this test can
fail unless you update to a fixed version (thanks Stefan Hajnoczi,
Daniel Berrang√©).

Added a test of nbdcopy with TLS which was previously untested.

Python code style tests are now opt-in using
 ./configure --enable-python-code-style

More tests should now run on FreeBSD and not be skipped.

nbdfuse tests now ensure that errors from NBD are transmitted through
FUSE back to the local client.

C<MALLOC_CHECK_> and C<MALLOC_PERTURB_> are only enabled when running
the tests, not when running libnbd programs from the build directory.
This makes it easier to do benchmarks.

=head2 Other improvements and bug fixes

The minimum C compiler is now ISO C99 (previously ANSI C90).

FUSE 3 (instead of FUSE 2) is now required to build nbdfuse.

The library tries harder not to leak thread-local storage memory on
dlclose or exit.  (Because of the design of Linux it is not always
possible to avoid this, especially in multithreaded programs.)

Fix the progress bar in L<nbdcopy(1)>.

UTF-8 export names are now processed and displayed properly by
L<nbdinfo(1)>.

The I<--help> output of nbdcopy, nbdfuse and nbdinfo now displays a
brief summary of all options and has some examples.

The generator now only requires ocamlc, not ocamlfind
(Abhay Raj Singh).

Golang bindings now use and require golang modules.

=head2 Documentation

Document using libnbd with the Meson build system.

Added Python examples.

Add example of how to integrate libnbd with libev (Nir Soffer).
