=head1 NAME

nbd_clear_meta_contexts - reset the list of requested meta contexts

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 #include <libnbd.h>

 int nbd_clear_meta_contexts (
       struct nbd_handle *h
     );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

During connection libnbd can negotiate zero or more metadata
contexts with the server.  Metadata contexts are features (such
as C<"base:allocation">) which describe information returned
by the L<nbd_block_status_64(3)> command (for C<"base:allocation">
this is whether blocks of data are allocated, zero or sparse).

This command resets the list of meta contexts to request back to
an empty list, for re-population by further use of
L<nbd_add_meta_context(3)>.  It is primarily useful when option
negotiation mode is selected (see L<nbd_set_opt_mode(3)>), for
altering the list of attempted contexts between subsequent export
queries.

=head1 HANDLE STATE

The handle must be
newly created, or
negotiating,
otherwise this call will return an error.
