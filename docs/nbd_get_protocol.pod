nbd_get_protocol - return the NBD protocol variant

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 #include <libnbd.h>

 const char * nbd_get_protocol (
                struct nbd_handle *h
              );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Return the NBD protocol variant in use on the connection.  At
the moment this returns one of the strings C<"oldstyle">,
C<"newstyle"> or C<"newstyle-fixed">.  Other strings might
be returned in the future.
Most modern NBD servers use C<"newstyle-fixed">.


This call does not block, because it returns data that is saved in
the handle from the NBD protocol handshake.

=head1 RETURN VALUE

This call returns a statically allocated string, valid for the
lifetime of the process or until libnbd is unloaded by
L<dlclose(3)>.  You B<must not> try to free the string.

=head1 ERRORS

On error C<NULL> is returned.

Refer to L<libnbd(3)/ERROR HANDLING>
for how to get further details of the error.

The following parameters must not be NULL: C<h>.
For more information see L<libnbd(3)/Non-NULL parameters>.

=head1 HANDLE STATE

The handle must be
negotiating, or
connected with the server, or
shut down,
otherwise this call will return an error.
