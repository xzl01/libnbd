nbd_aio_command_completed - check if the command completed

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 #include <libnbd.h>

 int nbd_aio_command_completed (
       struct nbd_handle *h, uint64_t cookie
     );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Return true if the command completed.  If this function returns
true then the command was successful and it has been retired.
Return false if the command is still in flight.  This can also
fail with an error in case the command failed (in this case
the command is also retired).  A command is retired either via
this command, or by using a completion callback which returns C<1>.

The C<cookie> parameter is the positive unique 64 bit cookie
for the command, as returned by a call such as L<nbd_aio_pread(3)>.
